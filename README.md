# A-_testing


## Description

This project is a testing of the A* algorithm. The algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two points in a grid. The grid is represented by a 2D array. The algorithm uses a heuristic to determine the next node to visit.
The heuristic is the sum of the distance from the start node to the current node and the distance from the current node to the end node.
The algorithm uses a priority queue to determine the next node to visit. The algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest path between two points if it exists. The algorithm is implemented in Python.


## Requirements

python >= 3.9

To run the project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**Setting Up the Environment**

* Windows: `./setup_Windows.bat`
* Linux/macOS: `./setup_Linux.sh`

These scripts will install required dependencies, and build a virtual environment for you if you don't have one.

## Usage

To run the project, you need to run the main.py file. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the A* algorithm. The algorithm was first described by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson, and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research Institute in 1968. The algorithm is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal problems.
